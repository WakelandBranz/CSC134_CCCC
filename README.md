# CSC134_CCCC

All of my collective work for the 2024-2025 school year for my C++ programming class at Central Carolina Community College. 



Course complete 12/4/2024 @ 1:19PM. Thank you Mr. Flannery!

Final grade 648/665. I did not submit the Chapter 1 Lab on Aug 28, 2024 so I lost 10 points right off the bat. Made up for it though.
