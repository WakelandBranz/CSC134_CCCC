# CSC134_CCCC

All of my collective work for the 2024-2025 school year for my C++ programming class at Central Carolina Community College. 



Course complete 12/4/2024 @ 1:19PM. Thank you for being so personable and forgiving Mr. Flannery (I submitted an assignment with half of the requirements on accident but he let me email what was needed and I got a 100%)

Final grade 648/665. I did not submit the Chapter 1 Lab on Aug 28, 2024 so I lost 10 points right off the bat. Made up for it though lol.
